/**
 * <p>
 * Title: JRuleEngine Project
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Description: This class exposes some simple properties of the
 * RuleExecutionSet to the runtime user. This interface can be extended by rule
 * engine providers to expose additional proprietary properties to the runtime
 * user. It is recommended but not required that any properties that are exposed
 * in such extensions be read only, and that their values be static for the
 * duration of the RuleSession.
